This is a work in progress. I am currently working with Sarah to move her [Wordpress site ](http://sarahpearsonphotography.com/)to GatsbyJS with a fresh design.

I began by drawing things out with Affinity Designer on my iPad Pro:

I have recently begun the coding process. Working with [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) has been challenging but very enjoyable. They're tools for asset management and content structure are simply amazing. If you haven't tried their product as a data source for a JAMstack site, I recommend you totally check them out!

Will post more updates as I make progress on Sarah's site.
