The North Mississippi Emmaus community consists of around 10,000 members with approximately 4,000 being active, contributing members. I recently rebuilt their site with a [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) backend to allow data to be easily updated by the community's registrar.

Sanity is also a great data source for [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) sites since it can call webhooks provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to trigger rebuilds each time the data is updated. I almost reached for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) on this one, but [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) seemed like a better fit for this project than NextJS since the event and member data only gets updated every couple of weeks.

This is an ongoing project with further enhancements ahead, such as online registration forms, social media integration, etc.

Considering that the membership of the community is private, I cannot show much of the site here, but it does in fact exist!
