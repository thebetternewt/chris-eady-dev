Hi. I'm Chris, and welcome to my website. I'm glad you're here!

I'm a full-stack developer who focuses primarily on Javascript, but I enjoy dabbling in other pragrammy things as well. Feel free to poke around and see things I've worked on.

# Right Now:

* Really enjoying using React (going on 2 years now).
* Learning new ways to use hooks daily.
* Using GraphQL more and more.
* Enjoying GatsbyJS with the JAMstack architecture.

## Workflow:

Lately, I've been learning to get my head out of code and focus more on design/UX. I recently picked up a [12.9" iPad Pro (1TB)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro) and been using it for design with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to create layouts for clients and projects before reaching for my MacBook Pro and start coding. This shift has helped me to get how of the _how_ and into the _what_. I am able to brainstorm more efficiently and give clients quicker responses with updated layouts as we work on a project together.

Overall, this shift from a "code-first" approach has been freeing and helped me to think more about the design and user experience before the technical side of things. It also has helped to (mostly) finalize a design so that I can reach for the right tools/framework/packages the first time around instead of coding things up multiple times.

## My Tools:

* [2018 12.9" iPad Pro (1TB)](https://www.apple.com/ipad/) w/[Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) & [ZUGU case](https://www.amazon.com/ZUGU-CASE-Muse-Case-Protective/dp/B07K1M4PHY/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1L03FT34MMSTQ&keywords=zugo+case+for+ipad+pro+12.9&qid=1562423065&s=gateway&sprefix=zugo+case%2Caps%2C328&sr=8-4)
* 2017 13" MacBook Pro (base model - no touchbar)
* [Paperback Moleskine journals](https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Cahier-Cover-Journal-Squared/dp/8883704967/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1RWB4105PV41N&keywords=moleskine+notebook&qid=1562423228&s=gateway&sprefix=mole%2Caps%2C567&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1) for sketching and brainstorming
